![Project Functionalities](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Functionalities-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=read-the-docs)

Our project consists on a tool to check code quality, based on several code stats given in a specific Excel file. Said file is in the root of our project. User then has access to 2 rules that exist by default. New rules can be added with any valid conditions, based on the given metrics. The 2 default rules can also have their thresholds edited for different results.


### How to use
* The user should start by importing the given excel file

* A frame will then appear with the information taken from that file. 
Other than the excel visualization window, the frame also has the following:
    * A dropdown with the list of available rules
    * An edit button (to edit existing rules)
    * An add button (to add new rules)
    * A button labeled "Check quality"
    
* When the user clicks on "Check quality", our tool will then go through every single rule and calculate the relevant metrics and results for each one. 
* This will open a new window with the rules' results, as well as the stats for DCI, DII, ADCI, ADII for the default rules.
